## Project Overview
This project provides a Python tool to simulate electric fields and potentials generated by simple charge distributions in a two-dimensional space. The simulation visualizes electric lines of force and the scalar electric potential, allowing users to better understand electrostatic concepts.

## Features
- Simulate point charges and uniform charge distributions.
- Visualize electric field lines and equipotential lines.
- Interactive plots to explore electric fields.
- Export plots for presentations or reports.Requirements

## Requirements
- Python
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation
Before using this project, make sure you have Python installed on your system. Install the required dependencies using pip:
```
pip install numpy matplotlib
```


## Theory
#### Electric Field: 
The electric field E around a charge is a vector field that represents the force per unit charge exerted on a positive test charge placed in the field. It is defined as:

                       E=F/q

#### Electric Potential:
The electric potential V at a point in an electric field is the work done in bringing a unit positive charge from infinity to that point, without any acceleration. It is given by:
               
                       V=k⋅Q/r
For multiple point charges, the total potential is the sum of the potentials due to each charge.

## Usage examples
### 1. Basic Simulation of Electric Potential and Field
The main components of the simulation are:
 - Electric potential (V): The electric potential at a point in space due to a charge is given by:
   
                                  V = k . q/r
 where:
  - k is Coulomb's constant.
  - q is the charge.
  - r is the distance from the charge to the point in space.

 - Electric field (E): The electric field is the gradient of the potential:
   
                                   E=−∇V

The simulation computes the potential and electric field at each point in a 2D grid for one or more point charges.
### 2. Example 
here is a basic usage example
```Python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define charge distribution
charges = [
    {"q": 1e-9, "position": np.array([2, 3])},  # Positive charge
    {"q": -1e-9, "position": np.array([-2, -3])},  # Negative charge
]

# Create a 2D grid for plotting
x = np.linspace(-5, 5, 100)
y = np.linspace(-5, 5, 100)
X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)

# Function to calculate the potential and electric field
def electric_field_and_potential(charges, X, Y):
    Ex, Ey = np.zeros(X.shape), np.zeros(Y.shape)
    V = np.zeros(X.shape)

    for charge in charges:
        q = charge["q"]
        pos = charge["position"]

        # Distance from charge to each point in the grid
        R = np.sqrt((X - pos[0]) ** 2 + (Y - pos[1]) ** 2)
        Ex += q * (X - pos[0]) / R ** 3
        Ey += q * (Y - pos[1]) / R ** 3
        V += q / R

    return Ex, Ey, V

# Compute the electric field and potential
Ex, Ey, V = electric_field_and_potential(charges, X, Y)

# Plot electric field lines
plt.streamplot(X, Y, Ex, Ey, color=np.sqrt(Ex**2 + Ey**2), cmap='inferno', linewidth=1)
plt.colorbar(label='Electric Field Magnitude')

# Plot potential contours
plt.contour(X, Y, V, levels=50, cmap='coolwarm')
plt.colorbar(label='Potential')

plt.xlabel('X-axis')
plt.ylabel('Y-axis')
plt.title('Electric Field and Potential')

plt.show()

```

### 3.Visualizing the Electric Field
To visualize the electric field vectors, we calculate the gradient of the potential in the x and y directions and plot the resulting vectors.
```Python
# Calculate the electric field as the negative gradient of the potential
Ex, Ey = np.gradient(-V)

# Plot the electric field as vectors using quiver
plt.figure(figsize=(6, 6))
plt.contourf(X, Y, V, levels=50, cmap='plasma')
plt.quiver(X, Y, Ex, Ey, color='white')
plt.colorbar(label='Electric Potential (V)')
plt.title('Electric Field from Multiple Charges')
plt.xlabel('x (m)')
plt.ylabel('y (m)')
plt.show()
```

## Conclusion
This Python tool enables users to visualize electric fields and potentials from various charge distributions in a 2D space. By modifying the charges list and utilizing the plotting features, users can gain insights into the behavior of electric fields in different scenarios.
